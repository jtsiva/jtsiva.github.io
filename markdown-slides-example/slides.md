# Lean into Audio

---

# Video has problems

- time consuming to develop
- harder to revise
- onscreen text is non-interactable

---

# Audio with markdown slides to the rescue!

- audio can be super engaging
- easier to make accessible
- markdown slides render as text on a webpage

---

# So what do we do now?

- design for audio unless video is strictly necessary
- make this widget easier to embed / production-ready
